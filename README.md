# TradingBot

A product x QU (quantity units) will be auctioned under 2 parties. 
The parties have each y MU (monetary units) for auction. 

They offer then simultaneously an arbitrary number of its MU on the first 2 QU of the product. 
After that, the bids will be visible to both.
The 2 QU of the product is awarded to who has offered the most MU; if both bid the same, then both get 1 QU. 

Both bidders must pay their amount - including the defeated. A bid of 0 MU is allowed. 

Bidding on each 2 QU is repeated until the supply of x QU is fully auctioned.
Each bidder aims to get a larger amount than its competitor.

In an auction wins the program that is able to get more QU than the other.
With a tie, the program that retains more MU wins.


### Run and usage

`mvn test` - to run tests of the project

This project is utils to use inbuilt in other projects, so there is no main class of other entry points. 
The `Bidder` interface and its realisation `BidderImpl` are started points to look at.
